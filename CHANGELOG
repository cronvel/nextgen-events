Documentation about compatibilities with Node.js built-in events.


v0.4.0
------

.emit() does not return the emitter anymore, but instead an object representing the event.
The method .setInterruptible() allow the emitter to be interruptible, i.e. when an event is emitted, a listener returning
a truthy value will abort the emitting process, other emitters will not receive the event.
Furthermore, an 'interrupt' event will be fired.
